# Word CLI

A Claude-powered command-line tool for editing Word documents using AI assistance.

## Overview

Word CLI provides a hybrid approach to Word document editing that combines the power of Pandoc's AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) for content manipulation with preservation of Word-specific metadata and formatting. This allows for precise, programmatic editing while maintaining full document fidelity.

## Architecture

### Hybrid AST + Metadata Approach

The core innovation is a three-layer document representation:

1. **Pandoc AST Layer** - Clean, semantic representation for content operations
2. **Metadata Preservation Layer** - Stores Word-specific features (styles, comments, track changes)  
3. **XML Fragment Layer** - Preserves complex elements that can't be represented in AST

### Key Components

- **Document Model** (`DocumentModel`) - Central hybrid representation
- **AST Handler** (`ASTHandler`) - Navigation and manipulation of document structure
- **Converters** - Bidirectional DOCX â†” AST conversion with metadata preservation
- **Version Control** (`VersionController`) - Git-like versioning for documents
- **Diff Engine** (`DiffEngine`) - Detailed change detection and visualization

## Features

### Current (Phase 1)

- âœ… Open and save Word documents with full fidelity
- âœ… Hybrid AST + metadata document representation
- âœ… Git-like version control (commit, checkout, branch, merge)
- âœ… Rich diff visualization (text, HTML, JSON formats)
- âœ… Document statistics and status reporting
- âœ… CLI interface with Typer

### Current (Phase 2) - AI Agent Integration

- âœ… **Natural language editing** - "Edit paragraph 3 to say...", "Find and replace all instances..."
- âœ… **Interactive chat mode** - Claude Code-like experience for document editing  
- âœ… **Smart tool execution** - AI agent uses 15+ specialized tools for precise operations
- âœ… **Cross-document operations** - "Copy the payment terms from contract.docx"
- âœ… **Transaction-based editing** - Atomic operations with rollback support
- âœ… **Advanced validation pipeline** - Multi-stage validation with auto-fix capabilities
- âœ… **Context-aware conversations** - Agent understands document structure and history

### Future (Phase 3)

- ðŸ”„ Advanced diff algorithms and semantic merging
- ðŸ”„ Multi-document batch operations  
- ðŸ”„ Template system and document generation
- ðŸ”„ Plugin architecture for custom tools

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/installing.html) installed and available in PATH
- Poetry for dependency management
- [Anthropic API key](https://console.anthropic.com/) for Claude integration

### Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd word-cli

# Install dependencies with Poetry
poetry install

# Install in development mode
poetry shell
pip install -e .

# Set your Anthropic API key
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"

# Create default configuration
word-cli config --create-default

# Test the installation
word-cli info
```

## Usage

### Basic Commands

```bash
# Open a Word document
word-cli open document.docx

# Start interactive AI editing (recommended)
word-cli chat document.docx

# Or start interactive mode with already opened document
word-cli interactive

# Show document status
word-cli status

# Show version history  
word-cli history

# Save changes
word-cli save --message "Updated introduction"

# Compare versions
word-cli diff v1 v2

# Manage configuration
word-cli config --show
word-cli config --set-model claude-3-opus-20240229
```

### Interactive AI Editing Examples

Once in chat mode, you can use natural language:

```
word-cli> Edit paragraph 3 to be more formal and professional

word-cli> Find all instances of "contract" and replace with "agreement"

word-cli> Add a new section about payment terms after the introduction

word-cli> Copy the liability clause from template.docx and insert it here

word-cli> Make the headings consistent - use sentence case throughout

word-cli> Summarize the document and show me its structure
```

### Version Control

```bash
# Show current status
word-cli status

# View history
word-cli history --count 10

# Create and switch branches
word-cli branch feature-editing
word-cli checkout feature-editing

# Compare versions
word-cli diff main feature-editing --format html --output diff.html
```

## Technical Details

### Document Representation

The `DocumentModel` class combines:
- `PandocAST` for content structure
- `WordMetadata` for document properties and styles  
- `XMLFragments` for complex elements (charts, equations)
- `ASTToXMLMapping` for round-trip fidelity

### Conversion Pipeline

1. **DOCX â†’ AST**: Extract content structure via Pandoc, preserve metadata via python-docx
2. **Edit Operations**: Manipulate AST while tracking changes
3. **AST â†’ DOCX**: Reconstruct Word format with metadata restoration

### Version Control

- Git-like model with commits, branches, and merges
- Diff-based change tracking
- Content-aware conflict detection
- Atomic transactions with rollback support

## Development

### Running Tests

```bash
poetry run pytest
```

### Code Quality

```bash
# Format code
poetry run black src/

# Sort imports  
poetry run isort src/

# Type checking
poetry run mypy src/

# Linting
poetry run flake8 src/
```

## Contributing

This is currently a greenfield development project. The architecture is designed to be extensible and the codebase follows Python best practices with comprehensive type hints and documentation.

## Architecture Decisions

### Why Hybrid AST + Metadata?

1. **Clean Editing Interface** - Pandoc AST provides semantic structure that's easy for LLMs to understand and manipulate
2. **Full Fidelity** - Separate metadata layer preserves Word-specific features that would be lost in pure AST conversion
3. **Round-trip Integrity** - XML fragment preservation ensures complex elements survive the conversion process

### Why Version Control?

- Enables safe experimentation with document changes
- Provides familiar git-like workflow for developers
- Supports branching for different document versions
- Essential foundation for AI-assisted editing where changes may need to be rolled back
